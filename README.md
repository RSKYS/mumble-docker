### Mumble? Murmur Docker!

This is really easy, you don't need to do anything out of order; install [docker](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/) & [docker-compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/) based on your distribution.

Then make sure you're on this directory and simply run:
```
sh run.sh
```
